Pick any file. Read it into a bytestream. Might be an issue if file is too big,
since I don't know if ByteString does any buffering. Will look at in the future,
for now simply read the entire file.

To start with, let's simply try to read a file and write it into the same directory that we
read it from.

Seems like I should use lazy bytestrings if possible.
